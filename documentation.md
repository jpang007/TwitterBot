So this project was something that my friend mentioned to me which would be a cool idea to implement. So I began to work on it and finally after so long I can finally say it works. I would like to implement more features in the future but for now this is okay.

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<br>
TwitterBot is a bot that "streams" new Tweets related to the phrase you provide it then in turn retweets and follows all accounts. The point of this project is to develop my first bot to actually perform a real world task. Using Tweepy, this is possible as we have easy access to the Twitter API.
<br>
<h2>How is this useful?<h2/>
<br>
We know that bots really are invovled in almost everything online, espeically when it comes to shopping for exclusive clothings, giveaways, etc. I wanted to develop my own that can potential win free stuff from Twitter (If you really believe that retweeting something will win you a free Iphone).
<br>
My main thought process through this project flip-flopped a lot, I was first attemping to store all the text IDs and user IDs into arrays and then retweet but that just causes issues mainly when you attempt to retweet a tweet that you have already tweeted. I experimented with streaming at first, switched to my own method, then switched back when I realized I was making no progress.
